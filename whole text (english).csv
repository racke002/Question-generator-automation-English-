"Hi, this is Dr. Perez Tamayo. Today we're going to talk a little bit about some of the
cardiac effects, heart, after breast cancer treatment on a long-term basis. Many of the
drugs that are used for breast cancer treatment may give you some side effects, and the side
effects may be on a long-term basis. If you notice that you are short of breath, that
your heart is having palpitations, if your feet are swelling, these may be manifestations
of heart disease or long-term cardiac toxicity. It's important to bring this to the attention
of your primary care physician and of your medical oncologist so that the appropriate
consults and referrals can be made.",
"One of the long-term side effects after breast cancer treatment is not only early menopause
or possibly menopausal symptoms, but grouped with this is the development of osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis is the thinning of the bones where the calcium is not being absorbed as
well. Many times the treatment consists of calcium and vitamin D, sometimes with an addition
of another drug. It's important to identify this early on and to keep checking on whether
one is osteoporotic or not to prevent fractures that could later be very disabling. Lifestyle
and activity has a lot to do with prevention of osteoporosis too, and keeping active and
exercising is one of the best in non-medical prevention.",
"Hi, this is Dr. Perez-Tamayo. Today I'm going to talk about one of the long-term side effects
of breast cancer treatment. It can be manifest as irritability, sleeping a long time, not
taking care of oneself, and these are manifestations sometimes of depression. Your body has undergone
a lot of changes, not only physically, mentally, but also hormonally. It's important to bring
this to the attention of your primary care physician so the different factors that contributed
to this state of mind can be teased away and made better. It's important to get the appropriate
referrals when one feels depressed after breast cancer treatment. Thank you.",
"Neuropathy is an irritation or damage to the peripheral nerves.
It's something that can happen after or during chemotherapy.
And it can be acute or it could be chronic.
It could last for a long time.
Usually the manifestations of neuropathy are numbness in the toes or in the hands or both
And a feeling of pins and needles, sometimes difficulties associating with walking or fine motor movements.
This can be a consequence of breast cancer treatment.
That can be a long-term consequence.",
"Breast cancer is often diagnosed when a woman feels a breast mass or when
there's an abnormal mammogram and most of the time it's diagnosed after a
needle biopsy. Treatment options include a removal of the breast or
preservation of the breast and that's a discussion that is carried on with a
surgeon. In addition to that the breast cancer is broadly divided into two types
non-invasive and invasive breast cancer. Usually non-invasive breast cancer you
do not need to sample any lymph nodes underneath the armpit and for invasive
breast cancer you do. This allows us to stage the breast cancer and give you
further recommendations.",
"The two major complaints with hormonal treatment for breast cancer have to do with postmenopausal
symptoms and that usually occurs in the younger premenopausal patient and the other common
complaint is arthritis and muscle pain and it usually is a complaint of a postmenopausal
woman.
For the premenopausal woman that is experiencing an abrupt change, hormonal change brought
about by these anti-hormones, these can be hot flashes, can be vaginal dryness, lack
of sex drive.
Most of these things are treated symptomatically and topically.
For vaginal dryness, there's topical agents that can be used.
For the lack of sex drive, that is something that you work out with your partner and with
your gynecologist and for the hot flashes, it would be the same recommendations that
one would give to a woman approaching menopause and that is to wear loose-fitting clothes
and to sometimes drink a lot more water and decrease certain carbohydrates in her diet.",
"Hi, this is Dr. Perez-Tomayo, and today I'm going to talk about some of the side effects
after surgery for breast cancer.
And I'm talking more of the long-term side effects rather than the acute side effects
after surgery.
One of the long-term side effects after surgery for breast cancer could be swelling of the
arm.
It's known as lymphedema.
It's important to recognize this early so physical therapy can intervene.
Many times a sleeve is measured out and prescribed.
Many times exercises are done.
It's important that one be preventive about the lymphedema early on so that the swelling
is not so tremendous that it causes skin changes.
Another common complaint by women after breast surgery, mainly mastectomy, is shoulder or
chest wall pain.
This can be acute and most of the time this acute pain goes away, but those women that
have a long-term effect of surgery such as pain in the shoulder or in the chest wall
can definitely be helped by physical therapy.
It's important to speak to your primary care provider and to your oncologist about this
so that the appropriate referrals can be made.",
"Hello, I'm Dr. Perez-Timayo and I'm a breast surgeon and through a series of small increments
and talks we will be talking about the different aspects of cancer care that go beyond and
after one has finished being treated for breast cancer and mainly these can be loosely aggregated
in a group called survivorship care.
It's important that survivorship care happen after the treatment of breast cancer.
One is to determine at what intervals one is going to be followed, what kind of tests
need to be done, to have a plan throughout the years how and if we will be able to detect
any metastatic cancer, to determine the psychosocial and economic aspects of that cancer treatment
on you, to determine if there's any interventions that need to be done as a consequence of the
breast cancer treatment with situations such as possibly lymphedema or menopause or osteoporosis
or cardiac issues and we will be talking about each one of these later on.
We can also coordinate the care between your primary care physician and the different specialists
that you still need to continue seeing on through the years and finally delineate the
roles between the oncology and the primary care, who takes care of ordering the mammogram,
who takes care of taking your blood test, should you be checked for diabetes and hypertension
and so a clear delineation of the role of each one of these providers.
Thank you.",
"Hi this is Dr. Perez-Tamayo. We're going to talk about one of the medications commonly prescribed
after breast cancer treatment that is after one has had the surgery and the chemotherapy and the
radiation therapy if any of these were involved. One of the more common ones is known as tamoxifen.
One takes it usually for about five years. It is associated sometimes with side effects. If you
are premenopausal the side effects seem to be a little bit more intense than if you're postmenopausal
and the side effects mainly consist of experiencing menopause that is hot flashes,
sometimes irritability. It's important also when one takes tamoxifen to make sure that
if you have a uterus to have a yearly pap smear as one of the side effects of tamoxifen can be
um producing a tumor in your uterus or a polyp or a bleed. Signs of blood clots also
are an important thing to watch out for when you're taking tamoxifen. Most of the time the
only symptom for most women is menopausal symptoms and that's why it's easily tolerated. Most of
these menopausal symptoms are more intense when you first start taking the medication
but become much less as time goes on in the usual period for taking the tamoxifen is about
five years.",
"Hi, this is Dr. Perez-Tamayo. One of the long-term effects of breast cancer treatment may be
decrease in vision. It's important to have an ophthalmologist or have an eye exam every
one or two years in order to detect the slow changes in vision. Many times it's manifest
by blurring, by seeing a halo, by yellowing of the colors, and sometimes even by an aversion
to light. Good eye hygiene is important. It's important to notice whether the vision is
decreasing, and this can be a long-term consequence of breast cancer treatment. Thank you.",
